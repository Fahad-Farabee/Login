# Login
This is just a sign up and sign in interface.
I have used file system here instead of database system to store the usernames and passwords. I have used javafx and scenebuilder to make the interface.
The sign up button will open a window where user will give a username and a password. the user will have to click on the submit button. On the right hand a sentence will show "Hello " + username. indecating the singup is successfull.
Here comes the file system to store the username and passwords.
In the home page user will give his name and pass , click sign in, if the user name and password is matched then there will be a massages saying "hello" + user name. if the username and passwords don't match then it will say "wrong username or password."
